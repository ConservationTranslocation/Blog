### Welcome

This website is dedicated to **research, documentation and data on conservation translocations** in the Western Palearctic for **a large audience of researchers, practitioners, stakeholders, decision-makers and people** interested in conservation translocations.  

### What are conservation translocations?

According to the [Conservation Translocation Specialist Group](https://iucn-ctsg.org/) of the [IUCN](https://www.iucn.org/), *“conservation translocation is the intentional movement and release of living organisms where the primary objective is a conservation benefit: this will usually comprise improving the conservation status of the focal species locally or globally, and/or restoring natural ecosystem functions or processes”* ([IUCN 2013](https://iucn-ctsg.org/policy-guidelines/conservation-translocation-guidelines/)). Conservation translocations include reintroductions, reinforcement, assisted colonisation and ecological replacement of a wide range of fauna, flora and fungi.  
  
  
## The Transloc project

The Transloc project is a **European Project** funded by the [BiodivRestore call](https://www.biodiversa.eu/2021/10/06/2020-2021-joint-call/) (Biodiversa+, WaterJPI, H2020 [here](https://www.biodiversa.eu/2022/10/25/transloc/)).  

It includes ten partners from 7 countries.  

Transloc aims to investigate and quantify **how local conservation translocations affect ecological, evolutionary and sociological trajectories of restoration at multiple scales in the Western Palearctic**. It mixes large databases and accurate case studies on a wide range of taxa.

The **TransLoc database** currently contains information about more than 1400 populations of species that have been voluntarily translocated in the Western Palearctic to restore their viability. More info on the database and the way to access and contribute [here](http://translocations.in2p3.fr/index.php).
