One of the objectives of the Transloc project is to question the relevance of translocation efforts under global changes.

However, the spatial distribution of translocation programmes might not be congruent with future scenarios of anthropogenic pressures, including climate and land-use change. Most species might not be able to cope with climate change and other pressures, such as land-use changes, which could have profound consequences on their distribution. The Transloc project asks the question of the potential consequences of these pressures on the success of past translocation programs and the lessons for future programs. 

Dr Anne-Christine MONNET just joined the Transloc project as a postdoctoral researcher to address this issue with Prof. Marc DufrÃªne at Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech in Belgium, granted by the National Fund for Scientific Research (F.R.S.-FNRS). She will assess how plant and animal populations translocated in the past decades across Europe are expected to face different scenarios of global change.
