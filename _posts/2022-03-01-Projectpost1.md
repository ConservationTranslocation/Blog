The multi-disciplinary project ‘Transloc - Translocations of flora and fauna for conservation and restoration: ecological, evolutionary, and socio-economic impacts, at multiple scales’, is officially underway! This three-year collaborative endeavour is funded by the joint call of BiodivERsA and WaterJPI [2020-2021 BiodivRestore](https://www.biodiversa.eu/2021/10/06/2020-2021-joint-call/) and brings together a consortium of 10 partners from 7 countries.

Transloc's primary aim is to **investigate and quantify how local conservation translocations affect ecological, evolutionary and sociological trajectories of restoration at multiple scales in the Western Palearctic**. The project will mix different approaches, ranging from database redesign and data analyses to modelling, field monitoring, and experiments of conservation translocations. 


Over recent years, three research laboratories in France, now actively participating in the Transloc project, have collaborated to create an online database on more than 1,300 conservation translocations in the Western Palearctic, concerning a wide range of taxa in terrestrial and aquatic habitats, including mammals, birds, plants, and lichens. The Transloc project is poised to expand and enhance this database by collecting complementary data on a wider range of taxa, such as reptiles, amphibians, molluscs, and insects. Furthermore, it aims to share this data with practitioners, stakeholders and researchers, thereby increasing common knowledge on conservation translocations and offer valuable insights for policymaking.


Additionally, a batch of ongoing well-monitored field translocations and experimental translocations will be analysed from ecological, economic, and social perspectives. These data will be used to establish common criteria for measuring success and performance. Modelling and serious games will be employed alongside case studies to generate translocation scenarios with local stakeholders. 

At the heart of the project lies the critical objective of establishing and building connections and nurturing collaboration with translocation practitioners, stakeholders (encompassing farmers, foresters, and local representatives), forming the project's core foundation. 

Stay tuned for fresh news about the project!
