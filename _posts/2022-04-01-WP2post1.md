One of the objectives of the Transloc project is to question the relevance of translocation efforts under global changes.

Her collaboration extends to 16 European institutes, collectively managing the data for the TransLoc project through the BiodivRestore Biodiversa/waterJPI call. Her responsibilities include creating and maintaining a collaborative platform using Git and QGIS, as well as redesigning the web interface and database using PHP, JQUERY, OpenLayers, and PostgreSQL. 

The platform is dedicated to serving researchers, practitioners, stakeholders, decision-makers, and the general public, fostering a comprehensive approach to species translocations for conservation purposes.
