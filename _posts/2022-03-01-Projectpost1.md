The multi-disciplinary project ‘Transloc - Translocations of flora and fauna for conservation and restoration: ecological, evolutionary, and socio-economic impacts, at multiple scales’ has just started! This 3-year project is funded by the joint call of BiodivERsA and WaterJPI [2020-2021 BiodivRestore](https://www.biodiversa.eu/2021/10/06/2020-2021-joint-call/) and involves 10 partners from 7 countries.

The main objective of Transloc is to **investigate and quantify how local conservation translocations affect ecological, evolutionary and sociological trajectories of restoration at multiple scales in the Western Palearctic**. It will mix different approaches, from database implementation and analyses to modelling, field monitoring, and experiments. 


Over the past years, three research labs in France, now involved in the Transloc project, have worked together to build an online database on more than 1,300 conservation translocations in the Western Palearctic, concerning a wide range of taxa in terrestrial and aquatic habitats (e.g., mammals, birds, plants, lichens). The Transloc project will allow the further development of this database, collecting complementary data on a wider range of taxa (e.g., reptiles, amphibians, molluscs, insects…), and disseminating data to practitioners, stakeholders and researchers, increasing common knowledge on conservation translocations and advise policies.


Additionally, a batch of ongoing well-monitored field translocations and experimental translocations will be analysed from ecological, economic, and social perspectives. All these data will be confronted with the development of shared success and performance criteria. Modelling and serious games will be performed with case studies to create translocation scenarios with local stakeholders. Networking with translocation practitioners, stakeholders (including farmers, foresters, and local representatives) and policymakers will be at the core of the project. 

Stay tuned for fresh news about the project!
