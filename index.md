## Welcome

This website is dedicated to the research on conservation translocations in the Western Palearctic.

### What are conservation translocations?

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Species Survival Commission (SSC) has created a disciplinary group dedicated to conservation translocations, The Conservation Translocation Specialist Group (CTSG), with member representation spanning all continents (for more information click here). The CTSG aims to advance science, inform government policy, train practitioners, and promote the application of conservation translocations to benefit nature. These activities acknowledge social, cultural, political, and economic considerations and often align to enhance tangible benefits to society.  

In this context, this group developed IUCN SSC Guidelines for Reintroductions and Other Conservation Translocations, which are designed to be applicable to the full spectrum of conservation translocations, including all species on Earth. They are based on principle rather than example and are developed to provide guidance on the justification, design and implementation of any conservation translocation. The guidelines are available in 8 languages and can be found here.  

### The Transloc project

The Transloc project was funded BIODIVERSA+ from the BiodivRestore call for transnational research projects on “Conservation and restoration of degraded ecosystems and their biodiversity, including a focus on aquatic systems” (for more information click here). 

The main objective of Transloc is to investigate and quantify how local conservation translocations affect ecological, evolutionary and sociological trajectories of restoration at multiple scales in the Western Palearctic. Mixing large databases and accurate case studies, this project particularly aims to i) document, quantify and analyse translocation efforts and efficacy; ii) investigate their congruence with future impacts of global change; iii) assess their motivations and socio-economic cobenefits; iv) develop and apply generic and multidimensional criteria to assess their impact on socio-ecosystem in the short and long terms; v) engage stakeholders and produce robust science-based policy recommendations for local to European-level action. 

Over the past years, three Parisian laboratories now involved in the Transloc project gathered information on more than 1,300 conservation translocations in the Western Palearctic, involving a wide range of taxa (e.g., mammals, birds, plants, lichens), in terrestrial and aquatic habitats. The Transloc project largely relies on pursuing the development of this database (see database below), collecting complementary data on a wider range of taxa (e.g., reptiles, amphibians, molluscs, insects), and disseminating data to practitioners, stakeholders and researchers to increase common knowledge on conservation translocations and advise policies. Additionally, a batch of ongoing well-monitored field translocations and experimental translocations are analysed from ecological, economical, and social points of view. All these data are to be confronted to the development of shared success and performance criteria. For some case studies, modelling and serious games are considered to build up translocation scenarios with local stakeholders. Beyond these local situations, networking with translocation practitioners, stakeholders including farmers, foresters, local representatives, and policy makers are at the core of the project.

## The TransLoc database 

The TransLoc database contains information about hundreds of populations of species that have been voluntarily translocated in the Western Palearctic, with the aim of improving the viability of the population. 


The above map shows 1413 translocated populations of animals, plants and fungi. Each point represents a translocated population, and its location corresponds to the centroid of the locality where the translocation event occurred or is still occurring, i.e., a municipality (most often) or a natural park, a reserve, an island, a cape, a peak, a lake… The precise locations of populations are not shown on this map. 

Every translocated population has a minimal information about the species translocated: the year and accurate or approximate (municipality, park, reserve...) location of the translocation, the type of translocation (reintroduction, reinforcement, or assisted colonization). Supplementary information includes categories related to the habitat type, the biological material, and the post-monitoring.

The last version of the database is available here.
